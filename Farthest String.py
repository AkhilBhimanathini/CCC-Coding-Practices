We define the Palindromic Distance of a String as the minimum number of characters that need to be modified in order to turn the String into a palindrome.

For example :

"cook" -> "cooc" (Palindrome),
Hence Distance("cook") = 1.

"fluffy" -> "flufff" -> "ffufff" -> "ffffff" (Palindrome),
Hence Distance("fluffy") = 3.

Now, you are given N number of strings, and your task is to find out which string has the farthest Distance from being a palindrome and print it.

INPUT
First line contains number of strings N.
Next N lines each contain one string.

OUTPUT
Print one string that is the farthest out of all strings from being a palindrome.

CONSTRAINTS
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 103
Each string has length of atmost 1000
Strings consists of lowercase english characters only
